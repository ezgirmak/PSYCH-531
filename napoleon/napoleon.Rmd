load the required packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

load in the data
```{r}
troops <- read_delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsmackler/PSYCH-531/master/napoleon/troops.txt", delim="\t", col_names = TRUE)
cities <- read_delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsmackler/PSYCH-531/master/napoleon/cities.txt", delim="\t", col_names = TRUE)

troops
```

plot just the paths
```{r}
ggplot(troops, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_path()
```

now add in some color based on the direction of (advance vs. retreat)
```{r}
ggplot(troops, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                   color = direction, size = survivors)) +
      geom_path()
```

round the ends of the path, so that it connects better
```{r}
ggplot(troops, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                   color = direction, size = survivors)) +
      geom_path(lineend = "round")
```


increase the width range scaling ("survivors")
```{r}
ggplot(troops, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                   color = direction, size = survivors)) +
      geom_path(lineend = "round")+
      scale_size(range = c(0.5, 15))
```

remove the labels and adjust the colors to make it look just like Minard's original plot
```{r}
ggplot(troops, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                   color = direction, size = survivors)) +
  geom_path(lineend = "round") +
  scale_size(range = c(0.5, 15)) + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#DFC17E", "#252523")) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) + 
  guides(color = FALSE, size = FALSE)
```

Add in the city labels
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = troops, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                               color = direction, size = survivors),
            lineend = "round") +
  geom_point(data = cities, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
  geom_text(data = cities, aes(x = long, y = lat, label = city),col="red", vjust = 1.5) +
  scale_size(range = c(0.5, 15)) + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#DFC17E", "#252523")) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) + 
  guides(color = FALSE, size = FALSE)
```
